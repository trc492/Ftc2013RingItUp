-= Note =-
These drivers are for RobotC 3.55 beta 2 and higher and are part of the
version 3.2 of the 3rd Party RobotC Drivers suite.

What's new in 3.2?
* Added new example for the Mindsensors Angle Sensor
* Added filtering capabilities to the Mindsensors IMU driver
* Added configuration and initial setup programs for NXT2WIFI
* You now need to configure a custom profile for the NXT2WIFI in order for the examples to work.  See benedetelli-nxt2wifi-config.c for details
* Added SMUX support for HiTechnic IR Seeker V2 enhanced mode through Sensor MUX.  Big thanks to Gus from HT for sending me the code and examples!
* dWiFi has undergone major changes, I need some people to help me test some of this stuff.
* Minor bug fixes in HiTechnic Angle Sensor and Compass
* Minimum version of ROBOTC is now 3.55 beta 2, which you can download here: http://www.robotc.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=5122, this has to do with a casting bug in 3.54 that affects many drivers.
